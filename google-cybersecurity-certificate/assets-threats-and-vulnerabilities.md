# Course 5: Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## Summary
This course explored the essential elements of cybersecurity risk: **assets**, **threats**, and **vulnerabilities**. I learned how to identify and classify assets, recognize different types of threats (internal, external, malicious, accidental), and assess vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat actors.

## Key Concepts
- **Assets** include data, hardware, software, people, and reputation.
- **Threats** can be intentional (e.g., hackers, insiders) or unintentional (e.g., human error, natural disasters).
- **Vulnerabilities** are weaknesses in a system that can be exploited.
- The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) helps prioritize protection of assets.
- Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Asset Value.

## Tools and Techniques
- Asset inventory systems
- Vulnerability scanners
- Threat modeling (e.g., STRIDE)
- Risk assessments
- Impact and likelihood analysis

## Practical Skills Gained
- Identifying critical business assets and classifying them
- Conducting basic vulnerability assessments
- Evaluating potential threats to a system
- Mapping risk scenarios using real-world examples

## Reflections
Understanding how assets, threats, and vulnerabilities interact helps me assess risk more clearly and prioritize what to protect. These fundamentals are critical to any cybersecurity role and are at the heart of risk management strategies.
