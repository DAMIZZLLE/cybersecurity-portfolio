# 📘 Course 4: Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

This course introduced me to the core tools used in cybersecurity—particularly the Linux command line and SQL. These tools are fundamental to understanding how systems work under the hood and how data can be queried, monitored, and managed securely.

## 🔧 Key Concepts & Tools

### 🐧 Linux Fundamentals
- Navigated Linux environments using CLI (Command Line Interface).
- Learned essential commands: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `nano`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `chmod`, and `chown`.
- Understood file system structure and permissions.
- Practiced using wildcards, piping (`|`), and redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`).

### 📜 Bash Scripting
- Wrote simple bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- Used variables, loops, and conditionals to manage logic.

### 💾 File and Process Management
- Checked system resource usage.
- Explored log files with `tail`, `less`, and `grep`.

## 🧠 SQL Basics

### 🗂️ Database Interaction
- Learned basic SQL syntax: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`.
- Used `JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.
- Practiced `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations securely.

### 🛡️ Security Relevance
- Understood how SQL is used to retrieve and analyze logs and system data.
- Discussed SQL injection attacks and safe query practices.
- Practiced writing queries to monitor suspicious activities in logs.

## 💡 Practical Application

- Connected to a remote Linux server and navigated through directories and files.
- Performed basic system administration tasks.
- Queried mock log databases for threat-hunting exercises.
- Combined Linux commands and SQL queries in investigative workflows.

## 🔐 Reflection

This course significantly boosted my confidence working with Linux and SQL—two tools I’ll use daily as a cybersecurity analyst. Knowing how to navigate systems and analyze data using these tools is essential for efficient threat detection and response.
