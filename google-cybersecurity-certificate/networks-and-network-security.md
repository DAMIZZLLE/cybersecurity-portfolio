# Networks and Network Security

## Course Summary

This course focused on the foundational concepts of networking and network security. I learned how computer networks operate, how data flows between devices, and how to identify, assess, and mitigate common network-based threats. I also explored tools and practices used to protect networks, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation.

## Key Topics Covered

- Basics of networking (LANs, WANs, IP addressing, TCP/IP)
- Network devices (routers, switches, access points)
- OSI and TCP/IP models
- Common network protocols (HTTP, DNS, DHCP, etc.)
- Network security principles
- Network-based threats (DoS, spoofing, sniffing, etc.)
- Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS/IPS)
- Network segmentation and VPNs
- Packet sniffing and traffic analysis
- Wireshark basics and hands-on labs

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Wireshark** – Used for packet sniffing and network traffic analysis.
- **Firewalls & VPNs** – Basic understanding of their deployment and configuration.

## Hands-On Activities

- Captured and analyzed packets using Wireshark.
- Interpreted traffic for common protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP).
- Identified network anomalies and potential threats.
- Explored firewall rules and configurations conceptually.

## Reflections

This course gave me confidence in understanding how data travels across networks and how those networks can be compromised or secured. Learning how to interpret packet data using Wireshark was particularly eye-opening, as I could see the raw traffic that attackers might exploit. I now have a solid foundation to build deeper network defense skills.
